This program depends on the requests, beautiful soup, yagmail, and keyring libraries
They can all be downloaded with a pip install 

The purpose of this program is to run a simple webscrape with some file input/output.
    - unique names assigned for each day with the daytime library 

In the 'Email' file, I use the yagmail library to send the email from a test email. 
    - to avoid the security issues inhardcoding the password, the user is prompted to type in password 

An example output file is attached to this folder as well.


The syntax for this project was learned from documentation of beautifulsoup and yagmail libraries at:
